# Jammming Codecademy project

This is the completed code of my Codecademy project.

The objective of this code is to connect to a Spotify API to search for songs, add it to their playlists and save the playlist into their spotify accounts.

 I had a bunch of helpful resources to help me complete this project. One of these is: "Jamming 2.0 using Functional Components| A Codecademy Project" by Sypher Sec.

I just updated it so that now the album pictures for the songs show up.
